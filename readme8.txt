This is not a tutorials. There are my codes created for the request below:

Create a basic webpage that will include a form field for user input with a button to process user input.

When the form button is clicked, the user entry will be added to the page content inside a div tag reserved for this purpose.  Each line of user input will be added enclosed in paragraph tags.

The output area will always add the next paragraph of content, without overwriting any previous content.  Each paragraph is to be numbered from 1 to n to verify no previous content is overwritten.

Provide a button that when clicked, will clear any user input that has already been added to the page.

You will create two versions of this page:

    Version 1 will use innerHTML to add each line of content to the page
    Version 2 will use the DOM method to add each line of content to the page
